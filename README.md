## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Centering the card and using proper spacing with the use u padding as with the previous projects.


### Continued development

As I've started from zero just a few months ago, I am still pretty satisfied with my overall ability to actually comprehend what I am supposed to do as I have zero experince with web development. 
I will of course continue to improve as I get feedback on best and best avoided practises and hopefully become even better.
